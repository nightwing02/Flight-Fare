## Flight-Fare 

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
In this project, I developed a flight fare prediction model using Python and deployed it on a local host using the Flask web framework. The model utilizes the Random Forest Regressor algorithm from the scikit-learn library and incorporates essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas,and Matplotlib.

## Key Features:
1. Data Collection and Preparation: Gathered a comprehensive dataset of historical flight data, including features like departure and arrival locations, travel dates, airline information, and corresponding fare prices. Performed data preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation, using Pandas and NumPy.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between different variables. Utilized Matplotlib to create visualizations, such as scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms, to analyze the distribution of fare prices and identify patterns or correlations in the data.
3. Model Development: Utilized the Random Forest Regressor algorithm from the scikit-learn library to build the flight fare prediction model. This ensemble learning method combines multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions.
4. Flask Web Application: Developed a user-friendly web application using the Flask framework to deploy the trained flight fare prediction model on a local host. 
5. User Interface: Designed an intuitive user interface that allows users to input relevant flight information, such as departure and arrival locations, travel dates, and airline preferences. Implemented data validation to ensure proper input format and handled potential errors or exceptions gracefully.
6. Prediction and Results: Utilized the trained Random Forest Regressor model to predict the flight fare based on the user's inputs. Displayed the predicted fare price to the user along with any additional relevant information, such as the airline, travel duration, or other useful details.
